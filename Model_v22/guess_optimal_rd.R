#kind of like debug files before
#check delta values and moment conditions for different values of rd and distance coef
#will fix rd to 4 and see if -15,-11 is better or -2,-70
#will check for rd = 0 and 4

#need to optimize the function which computes delta and moment conditions for handling large v0_vec, so that this can be done faster.
